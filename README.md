# Martingale-test-R
A test of stock market data in R

The **Martingale** strategy is a strategy were one bets that the price of a stock will go up, if they lose they will bet that it will go up again.
By doing this they bet that the stock will not be X consecutive downward increments (or "Bears").


This program will test all the permutations of a Up (Bull), or Down (Bear) and  see which permutation will go bankrupt first. 

The original ata was collected for Dukascopy Forex historical data. I calculated the "Bollinger Band" on it.

Currently the Data is Random
